I'm going to be honest here, I've never written a blog post, so I'm not quite sure how this is supposed to work. I assume you've read the little blurb at the top of the homepage, so I won't ramble on about myself.

Let's talk about something else, how about this site?

I initially had this site looking something like this:

Looks pretty much the exact same, right? Minus the 'logo' thing I have it's the exact same structure and colour. The big differences are that it's now made using Gatsby instead of HTML/CSS, which lets me make these blog posts easily.

I'm sure I'll have something more interesting to talk about later. For now, thanks for visiting!
